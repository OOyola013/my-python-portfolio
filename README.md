This portfolio showcases two of the projects I've completed while attending Reading Area Community College.
MyAddressBook - Once ran asks a series of questions to the user and directly stores the information to a text file.
myMovies - Once ran acts as an online shopping cart allowing the user to select movies for purchase, calculates the total cost, and provides an invoice for the customer.
